# DeepLearning.AI TensorFlow Developer Specialization

This repository contains my work and notes from courses in the [DeepLearning.AI TensorFlow Developer Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/tensorflow-in-practice) on Coursera.

## Overview

In this courses, I learned to build and train **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** using TensorFlow and Keras. The course involved working with real-world image datasets and implementing neural networks that can recognize patterns in complex visual data.

### Key Concepts Covered
- TensorFlow & Keras fundamentals for computer vision tasks
- Implementing CNNs using `Conv2D`, `MaxPooling2D`, `Dense`, `Flatten`, and `Dropout`
- Image preprocessing and normalization using `Rescaling` layers
- Custom training callbacks for early stopping
- Dataset creation using `image_dataset_from_directory` and `tf.data`
- Feature map visualization to interpret model behavior
- Real-time image classification using Jupyter widgets

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- TensorFlow / Keras
- Matplotlib
- NumPy
- Ipywidgets (for interactive image upload)
- tf.data.Dataset API
